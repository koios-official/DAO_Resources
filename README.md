## 1. Introduction to Koios and Scope of the DAO_Resources

Welcome to the official GitHub repository of Koios, a pioneering project in the blockchain world. Koios stands as a decentralized and elastic RESTful query layer, revolutionizing the way data is explored on the Cardano blockchain. Our aim is to facilitate seamless integration within applications, wallets, and explorers, ensuring a smooth and efficient experience for developers and users alike.
The `DAO_Resources` folder is a centralized repository for all essential documents and resources pertaining to the Koios DAO. This folder serves as the backbone for providing insights into our decentralized governance, tokenomics, and operational frameworks. Within, you'll find comprehensive documentation on the principles guiding the Koios DAO, detailed analysis and models of our token economy, and other pivotal resources that are crucial for understanding the inner workings and strategic direction of our DAO. It's designed to be a go-to source for contributors, developers, and stakeholders to access reliable, up-to-date information, fostering transparency and informed participation in our decentralized ecosystem.

## 2. Our Mission and Services

At Koios, our mission is to provide an open-source, elastic API layer that caters to the dynamic needs of the Cardano blockchain. Whether it's querying the Mainnet, testnets, or guildnet network, our API layer is designed to be flexible and user-friendly, making it an ideal choice for various blockchain-related data consumption requirements.

## 3. Features of Koios

The essence of Koios lies in its distributed and open-source nature, offering a public API query layer that is not only elastic but also equipped to address the increasing demands of the Cardano Blockchain. Our platform is built with a focus on ease of use, offering a RESTful layer that provides immense flexibility and caters to diverse data consumption needs.

## 4. Addressing Blockchain Challenges

In response to the challenges presented by the growing size of the Cardano blockchain, such as increased costs in maintaining query layers and inconsistent centralized solutions, Koios has developed an elastic infrastructure with built-in complex query solutions. This approach makes building on Cardano more accessible and efficient, ultimately contributing to a more robust and decentralized blockchain ecosystem ["](https://adapulse.io/koios-an-elastic-cardano-query-layer/#:~:text=Koios%20is%20an%20open,leading%20to%20inconsistent%20centralized%20solutions).

## 6. Key Resources and Campaigns

### [Provide To Subscribe Campaign](Provide_To_Subscribe.md)

The "Provide to Subscribe" Campaign is an innovative model for the initial distribution and liquidity provision of Koios tokens. Through this initiative, Stake Pool Operators and their delegators can actively participate in the liquidity pool by contributing ADA and Koios tokens, enhancing the tokenâ€™s usability and market presence. This campaign is vital for establishing a robust trading foundation on the decentralized [SundaeSwap DEX](https://sundae.fi/) platform.

### [Tokenomics](Tokenomics.md)

Our comprehensive Tokenomics document details the principles and strategies behind the issuance, distribution, and management of Koios tokens. This includes the distribution model, vesting schedules, and the strategic use of the treasury. Understanding our tokenomics is essential for participants and stakeholders to appreciate how value is created and sustained within the Koios ecosystem.

By exploring these resources, stakeholders can gain a deeper understanding of our strategic initiatives and participate more effectively in our growing decentralized community.
